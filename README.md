# MultithreadingShopping

Operating System project to illustrate Java multithreading.

## Information

The program simulates three different classes: customers, clerks, and cashiers.

Customers follow the following sequence of events:
- Shop for a random time before deciding on an item.
- Wait to receive slip from clerk.
- Proceed to see cashier and decide whether to pay with cash or credit.
- Wait for all other customers to finish shopping, then announce closing time (all other threads can now end).

## Installation Guide

Download and compile all files, then run Shopping. Enter custom values for customer, clerk, and cashier if desired.
